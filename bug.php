This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles array keys and type juggling.  The issue arises when using a string value that can also be interpreted as an integer as a key in an array. PHP may treat it numerically instead of as a string. For example:
```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray['10'] = 'ten';
$myArray[10] = 'tenMore';
print_r($myArray);
?>
```
This will only output one element, likely with the key `10` and the value `'tenMore'`. The string key `'10'` is treated as equivalent to the integer key `10`, leading to the overwriting of the first element.

This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not explicitly aware of this type coercion and rely on specific string keys.
